# Recreational Volleyball Assistant
This app is intended for Vancouver Gay Volleyball Association (VGVA) to help improve their check in 
process for various leagues but primarily for their recreational league which has seen a large 
jump in attendance. Seeing a need to help improve the scalability of this league, I decided
to put in the effort to create this app as a way to give back to my community and help
others get involved with VGVA.
